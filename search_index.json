This companion is available at r4ds.io/tmwr. This website is being developed by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Follow along, and join the community to participate. This companion follows the R4DS Online Learning Community Code of Conduct. "],["book-club-meetings.html", "Book club meetings", " Book club meetings Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book. This is the best way to learn the material. Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. More information about how to present is available in the github repo. Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the R4DS Online Learning Community YouTube Channel. "],["software-for-modeling.html", "Chapter 1 Software for modeling", " Chapter 1 Software for modeling Learning objectives: Recognize the principles around which the {tidymodels} packages were designed. Classify models as descriptive, inferential, and/or predictive. Define descriptive model. Define inferential model. Define predictive model. Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised models. Differentiate between regression and classification models. Differentiate between quantitative and qualitative data. Understand the roles that data can have in an analysis. Apply the data science process. Recognize the phases of modeling.

Avoid confusion: Software should facilitate proper usage. Avoid mistakes: Software should make it easy for users to do the right thing. "],["types-of-models.html", "1.2 Types of models", " 1.2 Types of models Descriptive models: Describe or illustrate characteristics of data. Inferential models: Make some statement of truth regarding a predefined conjecture or idea. Usually delayed feedback between inference and actual result. Predictive models: Produce the most accurate possible prediction for new data. Estimation (“How much?”) rather than inference (“Will it?”). Mechanistic models are derived using first principles to produce a model equation that is dependent on assumptions. Empirically driven models have more vague assumptions, and are derived directly from the data. "],["terminology.html", "1.3 Terminology", " 1.3 Terminology Unsupervised models learn patterns, clusters, etc, but lack an outcome variable. Examples: PCA, clustering, autoencoders. Supervised models have an outcome variable. Examples: linear regression, neural networks. Regression: numeric outcome Classification: ordered or unordered qualitative values. Quantitative data: numbers. Qualitative (nominal) data: non-numbers. Data can have different roles in analyses: Outcomes (labels, endpoints, dependent variables): the value being predicted in supervised models. Predictors (independent variables): the variables used to predict the outcome.

Don’t underestimate the time you’ll need for cleaning the data. It’s the step that the ’verse is named after! Take time to understand the data. Develop clear expectations of the goal of your model and how performance will be judged (Chapter 9). Feature engineering: Create specific model terms. Covered in Chapter 6. Model tuning and selection: Generate a variety of models and compare performance. Model evaluation: Use EDA-like analyses to choose the best model for your situation.
